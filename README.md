# civicrm-composer-upgrade-test

WIP initial attempt at https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/-/issues/142

Goal is to check from a range of starting points covering both
starting versions of Civicrm + Drupal and different install methods for Drupal

Ways of installing Drupal
drupal-composer/drupal-project
drupal/legacy-project
drupal/recommended-project

Drupal versions (for example 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, 9.0)

Civicrm versions (for example 5.27.0 5.28 5.29)

Options will be provide in a format that will define which
combinations get tested - i.e. this is not running all possible
combinations of provided params.
